Content:

- [ ] adding a description of the importance of the 'unit of analysis' in the structuring of the curated dataset
    - Note: this is touched upon in the 'Foundations' part, but it is important to see how this is implemented in the curation process. 
    - Also it should be mentioned that many times you want to keep the unit of observation and sometimes the unit of analysis somewhat flexible, so that you can explore different ways of framing the data (especially in the case of IDA approaches).

Exercises:

- [ ] add concept questions to Activities
- [ ] add exercises to Activities
- [ ] add thought questions/ case studies to prose sections

Formatting:

- [ ] cite the packages used
- [ ] cite the Europarle Corpus 
- [ ] correct the file names for Switchboard to reflect the dataset_curated.csv, and dataset_data_dictionary.csv format

In this chapter we will now look at the next step in a text analysis project: data curation. That is, the process of converting the original data we acquire to a tidy dataset. As Acquired data can come in a wide variety of formats that depend largely on the richness of the metadata that is included, but also can reflect individual preferences. In this chapter we will consider three general types of formats: (1) unstructured data, (2) structured data, and (3) semi-structured data. Regardless of the file type and the structure of the data, it will be necessary to consider how to curate a dataset that such that the structure reflects the basic the unit of analysis that we wish to investigate (see [Chapter 4, section 4.2](#sec-framing-research.html#research-question). The resulting dataset will be the base from which we will work to further transform the dataset such that it aligns with the analysis method(s) that we will implement. And as in previous implementation steps, we will discuss the important role of documentation.

## Unstructured

The bulk of text that is available in the wild is of the unstructured variety. Unstructured data is data that has not been organized to make the information contained within explicit. Explicit information that is included with data is called metadata. Metadata can be linguistic or non-linguistic in nature. So for unstructured data there is little to no metadata directly associated with the data. This information needs to be added or derived for the purposes of the research, either through manual inspection or (semi-)automatic processes. For now, however, our job is just to get the unstructured data into a structured format with a minimal set of metadata that we can derive from the resource. 

As an example of an unstructured source of text data, let's take a look at the [Europarle Parallel Corpus](https://www.statmt.org/europarl/), as introduced in [Chapter 2 "Understanding data"](#sec-understanding-data). This data contains parallel texts (source and translated documents) from the European Parliamentary proceedings for some 21 European languages. Here we will focus in on the translation from Spanish to English (Spanish-English). 

### Orientation

With the data downloaded into the `data/original/europarle/` directory we see that there are two files. One corresponding to the source language (Spanish) and one for the target language (English). 

```bash
data/original/europarle/
├── europarl-v7.es-en.en
└── europarl-v7.es-en.es
```

Looking at the first 10 lines of the first file, we can see that this is running text. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: unstructured-data-europarle-sample
#| comment: ">"
#| linewidth: 0.9
#| echo: false

readtext::readtext("data/understanding-data/formats_europarle-en_sample.txt") |>
  pull(text) |>
  cat(fill = TRUE)
```

The only meta information that we can surmise from these files is the fact that we know one is the source language and one is the target language and that each sentence is aligned (parallel) with the lines in the other file. 

So with what we have we'd like to create a data frame that has the seen in @tbl-cd-unstructured-europarle-structure-example.  

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-unstructured-europarle-structure-example
#| tbl-cap: "Idealized structure for the Europarle Corpus dataset."
#| echo: false

tribble(
  ~type, ~sentence_id, ~sentence,
  "Source", 1, "...sentence from source language",
  "Target", 1, "...sentence from target language"
) |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Tidy the data

To create this dataset structure lets's read the files with the `readtext()` function from readtext package and assign them to a meaningful variable.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-read-europarle-resources
#| include: false

# read the data from the resources directory
europarle_en <-  
  readtext::readtext("data/curate-datasets/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.en", verbosity = 0)

europarle_es <- 
  readtext::readtext("data/curate-datasets/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.es", verbosity = 0)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-read-europarle-show

# Read the Europarle files
europarle_en <-  # English target text
  readtext::readtext("../data/original/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.en", # path to the data
                     verbosity = 0) # don't show warnings

europarle_es <- # Spanish source text
  readtext::readtext("../data/original/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.es", # path to the data
                     verbosity = 0) # don't show warnings
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip
The `readtext()` function can read many different types of file formats, from structured to unstructured. However, it depends in large part on the extension of the file to recognize what algorithm to use when reading a file. In this particular case the Europarle files do not have a typical extension (they have `.en` and `.es`). The `readtext()` function will treat them as plain text (`.txt`), but it will throw a warning message. To suppress the warning message you can add the `verbosity = 0` argument.
:::

Now there are a couple things to note about thbe `europarle_en` and `europarle_es` objects. If we inspect their structure, we will find that the dimensions of the data frame that is created is one row by two columns. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-inspect-europarle-readtext-structure
#| linewidth: 0.9

str(europarle_en) # inspect the structure of the object
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip
Note that the `str()` function from base R is similar to `glimpse()`. However, `glimpse()` will attempt to show you as much data as possible. In this case since our column `text` is a very long character vector it will take a long time to render. I've chosen the `str()` function as it will automatically truncate the data.
:::

The columns are `doc_id` and `text`. `doc_id` is created by readtext to index each file that is read in. The `text` column is where the text appears. The fact that we only have one row means that all the text in the entire file is contained in one cell! We will want to break this cell up into rows for each sentence, but for now let's work with getting the columns to line up with our idealized dataset structure. 

First let's change the type of data frame that we are working with to a tibble. This will make sure we don't accidentally print hundreds of lines to our R Markdown output and/ or the R Console. Then we will rename the `doc_id` column to `type` and change the value of that column to "Target" (for English) and "Source" (for Spanish). 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-modify-dataset-structure

europarle_target <- 
  europarle_en |> # readtext data frame
  as_tibble() |> # convert to tibble
  rename(type = doc_id) |> # rename doc_id to type
  mutate(type = "Target") # change type value to 'Target'

europarle_source <- 
  europarle_es |> # readtext data frame
  as_tibble() |> # convert to tibble
  rename(type = doc_id) |> # rename doc_id to type
  mutate(type = "Source") # change type value to 'Source'
```

We have two objects now, one corresponding to the 'Source' and the other the 'Target' parallel texts. Let's now join these two datasets, one on top of the other --that is, by rows. We wil use the `bind_rows()` function for this.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-bind-europarle

europarle <- 
  bind_rows(europarle_target, europarle_source)

str(europarle) # inspect the structure of the object
```

The `europarle` dataset now has 2 columns, as before, and 2 rows --each corresponding to the distinct language types (Source/ Target). 

Remember our goal is to create a dataset structure with three columns `type`, `sentence_id`, and `sentence`. At the moment we have `type` and `text` --where `text` has all of the sentences in for each type in a cell. So we are going to want to break up the `text` column into sentences, group the sentences that are created by `type`, and then number these sentences so that they are aligned between the distinct types. 

To break up the text into sentences we are going to turn to the tidytext package. This package has a extremely useful function `unnest_tokens()` which provides an effective way to break text into various units (see `?tidytext::unnest_tokens` for a full list of token types). Since I know from looking at the raw text that each sentence is on its own line, the best strategy to break the text into sentence units is to find a way to break each line into a new row in our dataset. To do this we need to use the `token = "regex"` (for Regular Expression) and use the `pattern = "\\n"` which tells R to look for carriage returns to use as the breaking criterion.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-europarle-unnest-sentences

europarle_sentences <- 
  europarle |> 
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(output = sentence, # new column
                          input = text, # column to find text
                          token = "regex", # use a regular expression to break up the text
                          pattern = "\\n", # break text by carriage returns (returns after lines)
                          to_lower = FALSE) # do not lowercase the text

glimpse(europarle_sentences) # preview the structure
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip
Regular Expressions are a powerful pattern matching syntax. They are used extensively in text manipulation and we will see them again and again. A good website to practice Regular Expressions is [RegEx101](https://regex101.com/). You can also install the regexplain package in R to get access to a useful [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/). 
:::

Our new `europarle_sentences` object is a data frame with almost 4 million rows! The final step to get to our envisioned dataset structure is to add the `sentence_id` column which will be calculated by grouping the data by `type` and then assigning a row number to each of the sentences in each group. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-unstructured-europarle-add-sentence-id
#| tbl-cap: "First ten sentences in the Europarle Corpus curated dataset."

europarle_sentences_id <- 
  europarle_sentences |> # dataset
  group_by(type) |> # group by type
  mutate(sentence_id = row_number()) |> # add a row number for each sentence for each level of type
  select(type, sentence_id, sentence) |> # select the relevant columns to keep
  ungroup() |>  # ungroup by type
  arrange(sentence_id, type) # arrange the dataset

europarle_sentences_id |> 
  slice_head(n = 10) |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Write dataset

At this point we have the curated dataset (`europarle_sentences_id`) in a tidy format. This dataset, however, is only in the current R session. We will want to write this dataset to disk so that in the next step of the text analysis workflow (transform data) we will be able to start work on this dataset and make changes as needed to fit our analysis needs. 

We will leverage the project directory structure which has distinct directories for `original/` and `derived/` data(sets). 

```bash
data/
├── derived
└── original
```

Since this dataset is derived by our work, we will added it to the `derived/` directory. I'll create a `europarle/` directory just to keep things organized. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-write-europarle

# Write the curated dataset to disk
fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/europarle/") # create the europarle directory
write_csv(x = europarle_sentences_id, # object to write
          file = "../data/derived/europarle/europarle_curated.csv") # target file location/ name
```

This is how the directory structure under the `derived/` directory looks now. 

```bash
data/
├── derived
│   └── europarle
│       └── europarle_curated.csv
└── original
    └──europarle
        ├── europarl-v7.es-en.en
        └── europarl-v7.es-en.es
```

### Summary

In this section we worked with unstructured data and looked at how to read the data into an R session and manipulate the data to form a tidy dataset with a few columns that we could derive based on the information we have about the corpus. 

In our discussion we worked step by step to curate the Europarle Corpus, adding in intermediate steps for illustration purposes. However, in a more realistic case the code would most likely make more extensive use of piping (`|>`) to reduce the number of intermediate objects and make the code more legible. Below I've included a sample of what that code might look like.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-unstructured-europarle-summary-code

# Read data and set up `type` column
europarle_en <-  
  readtext::readtext("../data/original/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.en", # path to the data
                     verbosity = 0) |> # don't show warnings
  as_tibble() |> # covert to tibble
  rename(type = doc_id) |> # rename doc_id to type
  mutate(type = "Target") # change type value to 'Target'

europarle_es <- 
  readtext::readtext("../data/original/europarle/europarl-v7.es-en.en", # path to the data
                     verbosity = 0) |>  # don't show warnings
  as_tibble() |> # covert to tibble
  rename(type = doc_id) |> # rename doc_id to type
  mutate(type = "Source") # change type value to 'Source'

# Join the datasets by rows
europarle <- 
  bind_rows(europarle_en, europarle_es)

# Segment the `text` column into `sentence` units
europarle <- 
  europarle |> # dataset
  tidytext::unnest_tokens(output = sentence, # new column
                          input = text, # column to find text
                          token = "regex", # use a regular expression to break up the text
                          pattern = "\\n", # break text by carriage returns (returns after lines)
                          to_lower = FALSE) # do not lowercase the text

# Add `sentence_id` to each `type`
europarle <- 
  europarle |> # dataset
  group_by(type) |> # group by type
  mutate(sentence_id = row_number()) |> # add a row number for each sentence for each level of type
  select(type, sentence_id, sentence) |> # select the relevant columns to keep
  ungroup() |>  # ungroup by type
  arrange(sentence_id, type) # arrange the dataset

# Write the curated dataset to disk
fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/europarle/") # create the europarle directory
write_csv(x = europarle_sentences_id, # object to write
          file = "../data/derived/europarle/europarle_curated.csv") # target file location/ name
```

## Structured

On the opposite side of the spectrum from unstructured data, structured data includes more metadata information --often much more. The association of metadata with the language to be analyzed means that the data has already be curated to some degree, therefore it is more apt to discuss structured data as a dataset. There are two questions, however, that need to be taken into account. One, logistical question, is what file format the dataset is in and how to we read it into R. And the second, more research-based, is whether the data is curated in a fashion that makes sense for the current research. Let's look at each of these questions briefly and then get to a practical example. 

There are file formats which are purposely designed for storing structured datasets. Some very common file types are .csv, .xml, .json, etc. The data within these files is explicitly organized. For example, in a .csv file, the dataset structure is represented by delimiting the columns and rows by commas. 

```text
column_1,column_2,column_3
row 1 value 1,row 1 value 2,row 1 value 3
row 2 value 1,row 2 value 2,row 2 value 3
```

When read into R, the .csv file format is converted to a data frame with the appropriate structure. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structured-example-table-csv
#| tbl-cap: "Example .csv file in R"
#| echo: false

csv_file_example <- 
  read_csv(file = "data/curate-datasets/csv_file_example.csv")
csv_file_example |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

<!-- [ ] add xml or json format example? -->

With an understanding of how the information is encoding into a file, we can now turn to considerations about how the original dataset is structure and how that structure is to be used for a given research project. The curation process that is reflected in a structured dataset may or may not initially align with the goals of our research either in terms of the type(s) of information or the unit of analysis of the structured dataset. The aim, then, is to take advantage of the information and curate it such that it does align. 

As an example case of curating structured datasets, we will look at the song lyric datasets acquired from Last.fm in the [previous chapter](#sec-acquire-data). 

### Orientation

The individual datasets from the Last.fm webscrape are found inside the `data/original/lastfm/` directory, and includes the `README.md` documentation file.


```bash
data/
├── derived/
└── original/
    └── lastfm/
        ├── README.md
        ├── country.csv
        ├── hip_hop.csv
        ├── lyrics.csv
        ├── metal.csv
        ├── pop.csv
        └── rock.csv
```

Let's take a look at the structure of one of genres from these set of lyrics to familiarize ourselves with the structure. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structured-read-lastfm-single-show
#| tbl-cap: "Example file from the Last.fm dataset of song lyrics."

lf_country <- read_csv(file = "../data/original/lastfm/country.csv") # read the csv file
lf_country |> # dataset
  slice_head(n = 10) |> # first 10 observations 
knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE) # print pretty table
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structured-read-single-run
#| tbl-cap: "Example file from the Last.fm dataset of song lyrics."
#| echo: false
#| message: false

lf_country <- read_csv(file = "data/curate-datasets/lastfm/country.csv") # read the csv file
lf_country |> # dataset
  slice_head(n = 10) |> # first 10 observations 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE) # print pretty table
```

We can see a couple important characteristics from this preview of the dataset. First, we see the columns include `artist`, `song`, `lyrics`, `lyrics_url`, and `genre`. Second, we see that for each son the lyrics are segmented across multiple rows.

::: callout-warning
## Tip
You may notice that in addition to the lyrics being separated by line, there appears to be an artifact from the original webscrape of this data which has individual lyric lines run in to the next. An example is the the lyrics "... hurt myself toda**yT**osee if I still fee**lI** focus...". We will address this issue when it comes time to normalize the dataset in the transform process.
:::

Given the fact that each of these files will include a `genre` label, that means that we will be able to read in each of these files in one operation and the distinction between genres will be recoverable. The next thing to think about is how we want to curate the dataset for our purposes. That is, what should the base structure of our curated dataset look like? 

Let's make the assumption that we want to have the columns `artist`, `song`, `lyrics`, and `genre`. The `lyrics_url` could be useful for documentation purposes, but for our text analysis it does not appear to be very relevant --so we will drop it. The second aspect concerns the observations. As it stands, the dataset the observations reflect the formatting of the website from which the lyrics were drawn. A potentially better organization would to have each observation correspond to all the lyrics for a single song. In this case we will want to collapse the current `lyrics` column's values into lyrics for the entire song --maintaining the other measure for each of the other columns.

With this structure in mind, we are shooting for an idealized structure such as the one below. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structured-idealized-dataset
#| tbl-cap: "Idealized structure for the Last.fm dataset."
#| echo: false

tribble(
  ~artist, ~song, ~lyrics, ~genre,
  "Johnny Cash", "Hurt", "...lyrics for the song...", "country",
  "Johnny Cash", "Ring of Fire", "...lyrics for the song...", "country",
) |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Tidy the datasets

So our objectives are set, let's first read in all the files. To do this we will again use the `readtext()` function. But instead of reading one file at a time we will read all the files of interest (those with the .csv extension) in one go. The `readtext()` function allows for the use of 'wildcard' notation (`*`) in the file(s) path to enable pattern matching. 

So the files in the `data/original/lastfm/` directory look like this. 

```bash
../data/original/lastfm/README.md
../data/original/lastfm/country.csv
../data/original/lastfm/hip_hop.csv
../data/original/lastfm/lyrics.csv
../data/original/lastfm/metal.csv
../data/original/lastfm/pop.csv
../data/original/lastfm/rock.csv
```

We want all the files, except the `REAME.md` file. To do this we want our path to look like this: 

```bash
../data/original/lastfm/*.csv
```

The wildcard `*` replaces the genre names and this effectively only matches files ending in `.csv`. 

Great, that will capture the files we are looking for but when working with `readtext()` we will need to set the `text_field` argument to the column that corresponds to the text in our dataset. That is the `lyrics` column. Let's go ahead and do this and convert the result to a tibble.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structured-read-lastfm-all-show

lastfm <- 
  readtext(file = "../data/original/lastfm/*.csv", # files to match using *.csv
           text_field = "lyrics") |> # text column from the datasets
  as_tibble() # convert to a tibble

glimpse(lastfm) # preview
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structured-read-lastfm-all-run
#| echo: false

lastfm <- 
  readtext::readtext(file = "data/curate-datasets/lastfm/*.csv", # files to match using *.csv
           text_field = "lyrics") |> # text column from the datasets
  as_tibble() # convert to a tibble

glimpse(lastfm) # preview
```

Looking at the preview of the data frame we now have in `lastfm` there are a couple things to note. First, we see that a column `doc_id` has been added. This column is used by `readtext()` to index the file from which the data was read. In our case since we already have sufficient information to index our dataset, we can drop this column. Next we see that the `lyrics` column has been renamed to `text`. This is because we set this as the `text_field` when we read in the files. We can easily rename this column, but we'll leave that for later. 

Let's go ahead and drop the columns that we have decided will not figure in our curated dataset. We can use the `select()` function to either select those columns we want to keep or by using the `-` operator, identify the columns we want to drop. The decision of 'selecting' or 'deselecting' is usually one of personal choice and code succinctness. In this case, we are dropping two columns and keeping four, so let's deselect. I will assign the result to the same name as our current dataset, effectively overwriting that dataset. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structured-lastfm-drop-columns

lastfm <- # new dataset
  select(lastfm, # original dataset
         -doc_id, -lyrics_url) # drop these columns

glimpse(lastfm) # preview
```

Now let's work to collapse the lyrics in the `text` column by each distinct `artist`, `song`, and `genre` combination. We will use the `group_by()` function to create `artist` `song` `genre` groupings and then use `summarize()` to create a new column in which the `text` field is collapsed into all the song lyrics for this grouping. Inside the `summarize()` function we use `str_flatten()` with the argument `collapse = " "` to collapse each observation in `text` leaving a single whitespace between the observations (otherwise each line would then be joined contiguously to the next). 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structure-lastfm-collapse-text

lastfm <- 
  lastfm |> # dataset
  group_by(artist, song, genre) |> # grouping
  summarise(lyrics = str_flatten(text, collapse = " ")) |>  # collapse text into the new column `lyrics` (dropping `text`)
  ungroup() # unset the groupings

glimpse(lastfm) # preview
```

Let's take a look at the first 5 observations from this collapsed dataset. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structure-lastfm-collapse-table
#| tbl-cap: "Sample lyrics from Last.fm dataset collapsed by artist, song, and genre."

lastfm |> # dataset
  slice_head(n = 5) |> # first 5 observations
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE) # print pretty table
```

At this point, the only thing left to do to get this dataset to align with our idealized dataset structure is to organize the column ordering (using `select()`). I will also arrange the dataset alphabetically by `genre` and `artist` (using `arrange()`). 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-structure-lastfm-order-arrange
#| tbl-cap: "Sample lyrics from curated Last.fm dataset."

lastfm <- 
  lastfm |> # original dataset
  select(artist, song, lyrics, genre) |> # order columns (and rename `text` to `lyrics`)
  arrange(genre, artist) # arrange rows by `genre` and `artist`

lastfm |> # curated dataset
  slice_head(n = 5) |> # first 5 observations
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE) # print pretty table
```

### Write dataset

We now have a curated dataset that we can write to disk. Again, as with the Europarle Corpus dataset we curated before, we will write this dataset to the `data/derived/` directory --effectively ensuring that it is clear that this dataset was created by our project work. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structured-lastfm-write

fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/lastfm/") # create lastfm subdirectory
write_csv(lastfm, 
          file = "../data/derived/lastfm/lastfm_curated.csv") # write lastfm to disk and label as the curated dataset
```

And here's an overview of our new directory structure.

```bash
data/
├── derived/
│   └── lastfm/
│       └── lastfm_curated.csv
└── original/
    └── lastfm/
        ├── README.md
        ├── country.csv
        ├── hip_hop.csv
        ├── lyrics.csv
        ├── metal.csv
        ├── pop.csv
        └── rock.csv
```

### Summary

Again, to summarize, here is the code that will accomplish the steps we covered in this section on curating structured datasets. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-structured-code-summary

# Read Last.fm lyrics and subset relevant columns
lastfm <- 
  readtext(file = "../data/original/lastfm/*.csv", # files to match using *.csv
           text_field = "lyrics") |> # text column from the datasets
  as_tibble() |> # convert to a tibble
  select(-doc_id, -lyrics_url) # drop these columns

# Collapse text by artist, song, and genre grouping
lastfm <- 
  lastfm |> # dataset
  group_by(artist, song, genre) |> # grouping
  summarise(lyrics = str_flatten(text, collapse = " ")) |>  # collapse text into the new column `lyrics` (dropping `text`)
  ungroup() # unset the groupings

# Order columns and arrange rows
lastfm <- 
  lastfm |> # original dataset
  select(artist, song, lyrics, genre) |> # order columns (and rename `text` to `lyrics`)
  arrange(genre, artist) # arrange rows by `genre` and `artist`

# Write curated dataset to disk
fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/lastfm/") # create lastfm subdirectory
write_csv(lastfm, 
          file = "../data/derived/lastfm/lastfm_curated.csv") # write lastfm to disk and label as the curated dataset
```

## Semi-structured

At this point we have discussed curating unstructured data and structured datasets. Between these two extremes falls semi-structured data. And as the name suggests, it is a hybrid between unstructured and structured data. This means that there will be important structured metadata included with unstructured elements. The file formats and approaches to encoding the structured aspects of the data vary widely from resource to resource and therefore often requires more detailed attention to the structure of the data and often includes more sophisticated programming strategies to curate the data to produce a tidy dataset. 

As an example we will work with the The Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SDAC) which extends the [Switchboard Corpus](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC97S62) with speech act annotation. **(ADD CITATION)**

::: callout-warning
## Tip
The SDAC dialogues (`swb1_dialogact_annot.tar.gz`) are available as a [free download from the LDC](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC97S62/). To download, decompress, and organize this resource, follow the strategies discussed in ["Acquire data"](#acquire-data) for Direct Downloads. The tadr package provides the `tadr::get_compressed_data()` function to accomplish this step.
:::

### Orientation

The main directory structure of the SDAC data looks like this:

```bash
data/
├── derived/
└── original/
    └── sdac/
        ├── README
        ├── doc/
        ├── sw00utt/
        ├── sw01utt/
        ├── sw02utt/
        ├── sw03utt/
        ├── sw04utt/
        ├── sw05utt/
        ├── sw06utt/
        ├── sw07utt/
        ├── sw08utt/
        ├── sw09utt/
        ├── sw10utt/
        ├── sw11utt/
        ├── sw12utt/
        └── sw13utt/
```

The `README` file contains basic information about the resource, the `doc/` directory contains more detailed information about the dialog annotations, and each of the following directories prefixed with `sw...` contain individual conversation files. Here's a peek at internal structure of the first couple directories.

```bash
├── README
├── doc
│   └── manual.august1.html
├── sw00utt
│   ├── sw_0001_4325.utt
│   ├── sw_0002_4330.utt
│   ├── sw_0003_4103.utt
│   ├── sw_0004_4327.utt
│   ├── sw_0005_4646.utt
```

Let's take a look at the first conversation file (`sw_0001_4325.utt`) to see how it is structured.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-preview
#| echo: false
#| comment: ">"
#| linewidth: 0.9

readtext::readtext("data/understanding-data/formats_sdac_sample.txt", verbosity = 0) |> # sw_0001_4325.utt
    pull(text) |>
    cat(fill = TRUE)
```

There are few things to take note of here. First we see that the conversation files have a meta-data header offset from the conversation text by a line of `=` characters. Second the header contains meta-information of various types. Third, the text is interleaved with an annotation scheme. 

Some of the information may be readily understandable, such as the various pieces of meta-data in the header, but to get a better understanding of what information is encoded here let's take a look at the `README` file. In this file we get a birds eye view of what is going on. In short, the data includes 1155 telephone conversations between two people annotated with 42 'DAMSL' dialog act labels. The `README` file refers us to the `doc/manual.august1.html` file for more information on this scheme.

At this point we open the the `doc/manual.august1.html` file in a browser and do some investigation. We find out that 'DAMSL' stands for 'Discourse Annotation and Markup System of Labeling' and that the first characters of each line of the conversation text  correspond to one or a combination of labels for each utterance. So for our first utterances we have:

```plain
o = "Other"
qw = "Wh-Question"
qy^d = "Declarative Yes-No-Question"
+ = "Segment (multi-utterance)"
```

Each utterance is also labeled for speaker ('A' or 'B'), speaker turn ('1', '2', '3', etc.), and each utterance within that turn ('utt1', 'utt2', etc.). There is other annotation provided withing each utterance, but this should be enough to get us started on the conversations.

Now let's turn to the meta-data in the header. We see here that there is information about the creation of the file: 'FILENAME', 'TOPIC', 'DATE', etc. The `doc/manual.august1.html` file doesn't have much to say about this information so I returned to the [LDC Documentation](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC97S62/) and found more information in the [Online Documentation](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/docs/LDC97S62/) section. After some poking around in this documentation I discovered that that meta-data for each speaker in the corpus is found in the `caller_tab.csv` file. This tabular file does not contain column names, but the `caller_doc.txt` does. After inspecting these files manually and comparing them with the information in the conversation file I noticed that the 'FILENAME' information contained three pieces of useful information delimited by underscores `_`. 

```plain
*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*


FILENAME:	4325_1632_1519
TOPIC#:		323
DATE:		920323
TRANSCRIBER:	glp
```

The first information is the document id (`4325`), the second and third correspond to the speaker number: the first being speaker A (`1632`) and the second speaker B (`1519`).

In sum, we have 1155 conversation files. Each file has two parts, a header and text section, separated by a line of `=` characters. The header section contains a 'FILENAME' line which has the document id, and ids for speaker A and speaker B. The text section is annotated with DAMSL tags beginning each line, followed by speaker, turn number, utterance number, and the utterance text. With this knowledge in hand, let's set out to create a tidy dataset with the following column structure:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-semi-sdac-idealized-dataset
#| tbl-cap: "Idealized structure for the SDAC dataset."
#| echo: false

# Sample data (created with `dput()`)

structure(list(doc_id = c("4325", "4325", "4325"), damsl_tag = c("o ", 
"qw ", "qy^d "), speaker = c("A", "A", "B"), turn_num = c("1", 
"1", "2"), utterance_num = c("1", "2", "1"), utterance_text = c("Okay.  /", 
"{D So, }", "[ [ I guess, +"), speaker_id = c("1632", "1632", 
"1519")), .Names = c("doc_id", "damsl_tag", "speaker", "turn_num", 
"utterance_num", "utterance_text", "speaker_id"), row.names = c(NA, 
3L), class = "data.frame") |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

### Tidy the data

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-copy-data
#| include: false

# copy the original data from the `project_implementation` project
fs::dir_copy(path = "../project_implementation/data/original/sdac/", new_path = "data/curate-datasets/sdac/")
```

Let's begin by reading one of the conversation files into R as a character vector using the `read_lines()` function from the readr package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-read-example-file-show

doc <- 
  read_lines(file = "../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt") # read a single file as character vector
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-read-example-file-run
#| echo: false

doc <- 
  read_lines(file = "data/curate-datasets/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt") # read a single file as character vector
```

To isolate the vector element that contains the document and speaker ids, we use `str_detect()` from the stringr package. This function takes two arguments, a string and a pattern, and returns a logical value, `TRUE` if the pattern is matched or `FALSE` if not. We can use the output of this function, then, to subset the `doc` character vector and only return the vector element (line) that contains `digits_digits_digits` with a regular expression. The expression combines the digit matching operator `\\d` with the `+` operator to match 1 or more contiguous digits. We then separate three groups of `\\d+` with underscores `_`. The result is `\\d+_\\d+_\\d+`. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-doc-info-1

doc[str_detect(doc, pattern = "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+")] # isolate pattern
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip
The stringr package has a handy function `str_view()` and `str_view_all()` which allow for interactive pattern matching. There is also an RStudio Addin with the regexplain package which also can be very helpful for developing regular expression syntax.
:::

The next step is to extract the three digit sequences that correspond to the `doc_id`, `speaker_a_id`, and `speaker_b_id`. First we extract the pattern that we have identified with `str_extract()` and then we can break up the single character vector into multiple parts based on the underscore `_`. The `str_split()` function takes a string and then a pattern to use to split a character vector. It will return a list of character vectors. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-doc-info-2

doc[str_detect(doc, "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+")] |> # isolate pattern
  str_extract(pattern = "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+") |> # extract the pattern
  str_split(pattern = "_") # split the character vector
```

A **list** is a special object type in R. It is an unordered collection of objects whose lengths can differ (contrast this with a data frame which is a collection of objects whose lengths are the same --hence the tabular format). In this case we have a list of length 1, whose sole element is a character vector of length 3 --one element per segment returned from our split. This is a desired result in most cases as if we were to pass multiple character vectors to our `str_split()` function we don't want the results to be conflated as a single character vector blurring the distinction between the individual character vectors. If we *would* like to conflate, or *flatten* a list, we can use the `unlist()` function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-doc-info-3

doc[str_detect(doc, "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+")] |> # isolate pattern
  str_extract(pattern = "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+") |> # extract the pattern
  str_split(pattern = "_") |> # split the character vector
  unlist() # flatten the list to a character vector
```

Let's flatten the list in this case, as we have a single character vector, and assign this result to `doc_speaker_info`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-doc-info-4

doc_speaker_info <- 
  doc[str_detect(doc, "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+")] |> # isolate pattern
  str_extract(pattern = "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+") |> # extract the pattern
  str_split(pattern = "_") |>  # split the character vector
  unlist() # flatten the list to a character vector
```

`doc_speaker_info` is now a character vector of length three. Let's subset each of the elements and assign them to meaningful variable names so we can conveniently use them later on in the tidying process.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-doc-info-5

doc_id <- doc_speaker_info[1] # extract by index
speaker_a_id <- doc_speaker_info[2] # extract by index
speaker_b_id <- doc_speaker_info[3] # extract by index
```

The next step is to isolate the text section extracting it from rest of the document. As noted previously, a sequence of `=` separates the header section from the text section. What we need to do is to index the point in our character vector `doc` where that line occurs and then subset the `doc` from that point until the end of the character vector. Let's first find the point where the `=` sequence occurs. We will again use the `str_detect()` function to find the pattern we are looking for (a contiguous sequence of `=`), but then we will pass the logical result to the `which()` function which will return the element index number of this match. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text

doc |> 
  str_detect(pattern = "=+") |> # match 1 or more `=`
  which() # find vector index
```

So for this file `31` is the index in `doc` where the `=` sequence occurs. Now it is important to keep in mind that we are working with a single file from the `sdac/` data. We need to be cautious to not create a pattern that may be matched multiple times in another document in the corpus. As the `=+` pattern will match `=`, or `==`, or `===`, etc. it is not implausible to believe that there might be a `=` character on some other line in one of the other files. Let's update our regular expression to avoid this potential scenario by only matching sequences of three or more `=`. In this case we will make use of the curly bracket operators `{}`. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-2

doc |> 
  str_detect(pattern = "={3,}") |> # match 3 or more `=`
  which() # find vector index
```

We will get the same result for this file, but will safeguard ourselves a bit as it is unlikely we will find multiple matches for `===`, `====`, etc.

`31` is the index for the `=` sequence, but we want the next line to be where we start reading the text section. To do this we increment the index by 1.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-3

text_start_index <- 
  doc |> 
  str_detect(pattern = "={3,}") |> # match 3 or more `=` 
  which() # find vector index
text_start_index <- text_start_index + 1 # increment index by 1
```

The index for the end of the text is simply the length of the `doc` vector. We can use the `length()` function to get this index.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-4

text_end_index <- length(doc)
```

We now have the bookends, so to speak, for our text section. To extract the text we subset the `doc` vector by these indices.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-5

text <- doc[text_start_index:text_end_index] # extract text
head(text) # preview first lines of `text`
```

The text has some extra whitespace on some lines and there are blank lines as well. We should do some cleaning up before moving forward to organize the data. To get rid of the whitespace we use the `str_trim()` function which by default will remove leading and trailing whitespace from each line.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-6

text <- str_trim(text) # remove leading and trailing whitespace
head(text) # preview first lines of `text`
```

To remove blank lines we will use the a logical expression to subset the `text` vector. `text != ""` means return TRUE where lines are not blank, and FALSE where they are.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-7

text <- text[text != ""] # remove blank lines
head(text) # preview first lines of `text`
```

Our first step towards a tidy dataset is to now combine the `doc_id` and each element of `text` in a data frame. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-semi-sdac-text-8
#| tbl-cap: "First 5 observations of prelim data curation of the SDAC data."

data <- data.frame(doc_id, text) # tidy format `doc_id` and `text`
slice_head(data, n = 5) |> # preview first lines of `text`
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

With our data now in a data frame, its time to parse the `text` column and extract the damsl tags, speaker, speaker turn, utterance number, and the utterance text itself into separate columns. To do this we will make extensive use of regular expressions. Our aim is to find a consistent pattern that distinguishes each piece of information from other other text in a given row of `data$text` and extract it. 

The best way to learn regular expressions is to use them. To this end I've included a link to the interactive regular expression practice website [regex101](https://regex101.com).

Open this site and copy the text below into the 'TEST STRING' field.  

```plain
o          A.1 utt1: Okay.  /
qw          A.1 utt2: {D So, }
qy^d          B.2 utt1: [ [ I guess, +
+          A.3 utt1: What kind of experience [ do you, + do you ] have, then with child care? /
+          B.4 utt1: I think, ] + {F uh, } I wonder ] if that worked. /
qy          A.5 utt1: Does it say something? /
sd          B.6 utt1: I think it usually does.  /
ad          B.6 utt2: You might try, {F uh, }  /
h          B.6 utt3: I don't know,  /
ad          B.6 utt4: hold it down a little longer,  /
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: fig-cd-regex-101-image
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "RegEx101"

knitr::include_graphics("figures/curate-datasets/cd-regex-101.png")
```

Now manually type the following regular expressions into the 'REGULAR EXPRESSION' field one-by-one (each is on a separate line). Notice what is matched as you type and when you've finished typing. You can find out exactly what the component parts of each expression are doing by toggling the top right icon in the window or hovering your mouse over the relevant parts of the expression.

```plain
^.+?\s
[AB]\.\d+
utt\d+
:.+$
```

As you can now see, we have regular expressions that will match the damsl tags, speaker and speaker turn, utterance number, and the utterance text. To apply these expressions to our data and extract this information into separate columns we will make use of the `mutate()` and `str_extract()` functions. `mutate()` will take our data frame and create new columns with values we match and extract from each row in the data frame with `str_extract()`. Notice that `str_extract()` is different than `str_extract_all()`. When we work with `mutate()` each row will be evaluated in turn, therefore we only need to make one match per row in `data$text`. 

I've chained each of these steps in the code below, dropping the original `text` column with `select(-text)`, and overwriting `data` with the results.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-parse

# Extract column information from `text`
data <- 
  data |> # current dataset
  mutate(damsl_tag = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "^.+?\\s")) |>  # extract damsl tags
  mutate(speaker_turn = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "[AB]\\.\\d+")) |> # extract speaker_turn pairs
  mutate(utterance_num = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "utt\\d+")) |> # extract utterance number
  mutate(utterance_text = str_extract(string = text, pattern = ":.+$")) |>  # extract utterance text
  select(-text) # drop the `text` column

glimpse(data) # preview the data set
```

::: callout-warning
## Tip
One twist you will notice is that regular expressions in R require double backslashes (`\\\\`) where other programming environments use a single backslash (`\\`).
:::

There are a couple things left to do to the columns we extracted from the text before we move on to finishing up our tidy dataset. First, we need to separate the `speaker_turn` column into `speaker` and `turn_num` columns and second we need to remove unwanted characters from the `damsl_tag`, `utterance_num`, and `utterance_text` columns. 

To separate the values of a column into two columns we use the `separate()` function. It takes a column to separate and character vector of the names of the new columns to create. By default the values of the input column will be separated by non-alphanumeric characters. In our case this means the `.` will be our separator.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-organize

data <-
  data |> # current dataset
  separate(col = speaker_turn, # source column
           into = c("speaker", "turn_num")) # separate speaker_turn into distinct columns: speaker and turn_num

glimpse(data) # preview the data set
```

To remove unwanted leading or trailing whitespace we apply the `str_trim()` function. For removing other characters we matching the character(s) and replace them with an empty string (`""`) with the `str_replace()` function. Again, I've chained these functions together and overwritten `data` with the results.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-text-clean

# Clean up column information
data <- 
  data |> # current dataset
  mutate(damsl_tag = str_trim(damsl_tag)) |> # remove leading/ trailing whitespace
  mutate(utterance_num = str_replace(string = utterance_num, pattern = "utt", replacement = "")) |> # remove 'utt'
  mutate(utterance_text = str_replace(string = utterance_text, pattern = ":\\s", replacement = "")) |> # remove ': '
  mutate(utterance_text = str_trim(utterance_text)) # trim leading/ trailing whitespace

glimpse(data) # preview the data set
```

To round out our tidy dataset for this single conversation file we will connect the `speaker_a_id` and `speaker_b_id` with speaker A and B in our current dataset adding a new column `speaker_id`. The `case_when()` function does exactly this: allows us to map rows of `speaker` with the value "A" to `speaker_a_id` and rows with value "B" to `speaker_b_id`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-speaker-ids

# Link speaker with speaker_id
data <- 
  data |> # current dataset
  mutate(speaker_id = case_when( # create speaker_id
    speaker == "A" ~ speaker_a_id, # speaker_a_id value when A
    speaker == "B" ~ speaker_b_id # speaker_b_id value when B
  ))

glimpse(data) # preview the data set
```

We now have the tidy dataset we set out to create. But this dataset only includes one conversation file! We want to apply this code to all 1155 conversation files in the `sdac/` corpus. The approach will be to create a custom function which groups the code we've done for this single file and then iterative send each file from the corpus through this function and combine the results into one data frame. 

Here's the custom function with some extra code to print a progress message for each file when it runs. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-extract-sdac-metadata-function

extract_sdac_metadata <- function(file) {
  # Function: to read a Switchboard Corpus Dialogue file and extract meta-data
  cat("Reading", basename(file), "...")
  
  # Read `file` by lines
  doc <- read_lines(file) 
  
  # Extract `doc_id`, `speaker_a_id`, and `speaker_b_id`
  doc_speaker_info <- 
    doc[str_detect(doc, "\\d+_\\d+_\\d+")] |> # isolate pattern
    str_extract("\\d+_\\d+_\\d+") |> # extract the pattern
    str_split(pattern = "_") |> # split the character vector
    unlist() # flatten the list to a character vector
  doc_id <- doc_speaker_info[1] # extract `doc_id`
  speaker_a_id <- doc_speaker_info[2] # extract `speaker_a_id`
  speaker_b_id <- doc_speaker_info[3] # extract `speaker_b_id`
  
  # Extract `text`
  text_start_index <- # find where header info stops
    doc |> 
    str_detect(pattern = "={3,}") |> # match 3 or more `=`
    which() # find vector index
  
  text_start_index <- text_start_index + 1 # increment index by 1
  text_end_index <- length(doc) # get the end of the text section
  
  text <- doc[text_start_index:text_end_index] # extract text
  text <- str_trim(text) # remove leading and trailing whitespace
  text <- text[text != ""] # remove blank lines
  
  data <- data.frame(doc_id, text) # tidy format `doc_id` and `text`
  
  # Extract column information from `text`
  data <- 
    data |> 
    mutate(damsl_tag = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "^.+?\\s")) |>  # extract damsl tags
    mutate(speaker_turn = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "[AB]\\.\\d+")) |> # extract speaker_turn pairs
    mutate(utterance_num = str_extract(string = text, pattern = "utt\\d+")) |> # extract utterance number
    mutate(utterance_text = str_extract(string = text, pattern = ":.+$")) |>  # extract utterance text
    select(-text)
  
  # Separate speaker_turn into distinct columns
  data <-
    data |> # current dataset
    separate(col = speaker_turn, # source column
             into = c("speaker", "turn_num")) # separate speaker_turn into distinct columns: speaker and turn_num
  
  # Clean up column information
  data <- 
    data |> 
    mutate(damsl_tag = str_trim(damsl_tag)) |> # remove leading/ trailing whitespace
    mutate(utterance_num = str_replace(string = utterance_num, pattern = "utt", replacement = "")) |> # remove 'utt'
    mutate(utterance_text = str_replace(string = utterance_text, pattern = ":\\s", replacement = "")) |> # remove ': '
    mutate(utterance_text = str_trim(utterance_text)) # trim leading/ trailing whitespace
  
  # Link speaker with speaker_id
  data <- 
    data |> # current dataset
    mutate(speaker_id = case_when( # create speaker_id
      speaker == "A" ~ speaker_a_id, # speaker_a_id value when A
      speaker == "B" ~ speaker_b_id # speaker_b_id value when B
    ))
  cat(" done.\n")
  return(data) # return the data frame object
}
```

As a sanity check we will run the `extract_sdac_metadata()` function on a the conversation file we were just working on to make sure it works as expected.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-extract-sdac-metadata-test-show

extract_sdac_metadata(file = "../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt") |> 
  glimpse()
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-extract-sdac-metadata-test-run
#| echo: false

extract_sdac_metadata(file = "data/curate-datasets/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt") |> 
  glimpse()
```

Looks good!

So now it's time to create a vector with the paths to all of the conversation files. `fs::dir_ls()` interfaces with our OS file system and will return the paths to the files in the specified directory. We also add a pattern to match conversation files (`regexp = \\.utt$`) so we don't accidentally include other files in the corpus. `recurse` set to `TRUE` means we will get the full path to each file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-list-files-show

sdac_files <- 
  fs::dir_ls(path = "../data/original/sdac/", # source directory
             recurse = TRUE, # traverse all sub-directories
             type = "file", # only return files
             regexp = "\\.utt$") # only return files ending in .utt
head(sdac_files) # preview file paths
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-list-files-run
#| echo: false
#| results: hide

sdac_files <- 
  fs::dir_ls(path = "data/curate-datasets/sdac/", # source directory
             recurse = TRUE, # traverse all sub-directories
             type = "file", # only return files
             regexp = "\\.utt$") # only return files ending in .utt
head(sdac_files)
```

```plain
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0002_4330.utt
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0003_4103.utt
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0004_4327.utt
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0005_4646.utt
../data/original/sdac/sw00utt/sw_0006_4108.utt
```

o pass each conversation file in the vector of paths to our conversation files iteratively to the `extract_sdac_metadata()` function we use `map()`. This will apply the function to each conversation file and return a data frame for each. `bind_rows()` will then join the resulting data frames by rows to give us a single tidy dataset for all 1155 conversations. Note there is a lot of processing going on here we have to be patient.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-tidy-all
#| results: hide

# Read files and return a tidy dataset
sdac <- 
  sdac_files |> # pass file names
  map(extract_sdac_metadata) |> # read and tidy iteratively 
  bind_rows() # bind the results into a single data frame
```

We now see that we have `nrow(sdac)` observations (individual utterances in this dataset). 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-preview-complete

glimpse(sdac) # preview complete curated dataset
```

### Write datasets

Again as in the previous cases, we will write this dataset to disk to prepare for the next step in our text analysis project. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-write

fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/sdac/") # create sdac subdirectory
write_csv(sdac, 
          file = "../data/derived/sdac/sdac_curated.csv") # write sdac to disk and label as the curated dataset
```

The directory structure now looks like this: 

```bash
data/
├── derived/
│   └── sdac/
│       └── sdac_curated.csv
└── original/
    └── sdac/
        ├── README
        ├── doc/
        ├── sw00utt/
        ├── sw01utt/
        ├── sw02utt/
        ├── sw03utt/
        ├── sw04utt/
        ├── sw05utt/
        ├── sw06utt/
        ├── sw07utt/
        ├── sw08utt/
        ├── sw09utt/
        ├── sw10utt/
        ├── sw11utt/
        ├── sw12utt/
        └── sw13utt/
```

### Summary

In this section we looked at semi-structured data. This type of data often requires the most work to organize into a tidy dataset. We continued to work with many of the R programming strategies introduced to this point in the coursebook. We also made more extensive use of regular expressions to pick out information from a semi-structured document format.

To round out this section I've provided a code summary of the steps involved to conduct the curation of the Switchboard Dialogue Act Corpus files. Note that I've added the `extract_sdac_metadata()` custom function to a file called `curate_functions.R` and sourced this file. This will make the code more succinct and legible here, as well in your own research projects. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-semi-sdac-summary-code

# Source the `extract_sdac_metadata()` function
source("../functions/curate_functions.R") 

# Get list of the corpus files (.utt)
sdac_files <- 
  fs::dir_ls(path = "../data/original/sdac/", # source directory
             recurse = TRUE, # traverse all sub-directories
             type = "file", # only return files
             regexp = "\\.utt$") # only return files ending in .utt

# Read files and return a tidy dataset
sdac <- 
  sdac_files |> # pass file names
  map(extract_sdac_metadata) |> # read and tidy iteratively 
  bind_rows() # bind the results into a single data frame
  
# Write curated dataset to disk
fs::dir_create(path = "../data/derived/sdac/") # create sdac subdirectory
write_csv(sdac, 
          file = "../data/derived/sdac/sdac_curated.csv") # write sdac to disk and label as the curated dataset
```

## Documentation

At this stage we again want to ensure that the data that we have derived is well-documented. Where in the data acquisition process the documentation was focused on the sampling frame, curated datasets require documentation that describes the structure of the now rectangular dataset and its attributes. This documentation is known as a **data dictionary**. At the curation stage this documentation often contains the following information [@HowMakeData10-2021]: 

- names of the variables (as they appear in the dataset)
- human-readable names for the variables
- short prose descriptions of the variables, including units of measurement (where applicable)

A data dictionary will take the format of a table and can be stored in a tabular-oriented file format (such as .csv). It is often easier to work with a spreadsheet to create this documentation. I suggest creating a .csv file with the basic structure of the documentation. You can do this however you choose, but I suggest using something along these lines as seen in the following custom function, `data_dic_starter()`. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-documentation-dic-starter-function"

data_dic_starter <- function(data, file_path) {
  # Function:
  # Creates a .csv file with the basic information
  # to document a curated dataset
  
  tibble(variable_name = names(data), # column with existing variable names 
       name = "", # column for human-readable names
       description = "") |> # column for prose description
  write_csv(file = file_path) # write to disk
}
```

Running this function in the R Console on the curated dataset (in this case the `sdac` dataset), will provide this structure. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: tbl-cd-documentation-dic-starter-structure
#| tbl-cap: "Data dictionary starter structure for the SDAC curated dataset."
#| echo: false

tibble(variable_name = names(sdac), name = "", description = "") |> 
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE)
```

The resulting .csv file can then be opened with spreadsheet software (such as MS Excel, Google Sheets, etc.) and edited.^[Note on RStudio Cloud you will need to download the .csv file and, after editing, upload the complete data dictionary file. Make sure to save the edited file as a .csv file.]

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: cd-documentation-starter-edit"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("figures/curate-datasets/cd-data-dictionary.png")
```

Save this file as a .csv file and replace the original starter file. Note that it is important to use a plain-text file format for the official documentation file and avoid proprietary formats to ensure open accessibility and future compatibility.^[Although based on spreadsheets, @Broman2018 outlines many of the best for good data organization regardless of the technology.]

Our `data/derived/` directory now looks like this.

```bash
data/
└── derived/
    └── sdac/
        ├── sdac_curated.csv
        └── data_dictionary_sdac.csv
```

## Summary {.unnumbered}

In this chapter we looked at the process of structuring data into a dataset. This included a discussion on three main types of data --unstructured, structured, and semi-structured. The level of structure of the original data(set) will vary from resource to resource and by the same token so will the file format used to support the level of meta-information included. The results from our data curation resulted in a curated dataset that is saved separate from the original data to maintain modularity between what the data(set) looked like before we intervene and afterwards. In addition to the code we use to derived the curated dataset's structure, we also include a data dictionary which documents the names of the variables and provides sufficient description of these variables so that it is clear what our dataset contains.

It is important to recognized that this curated dataset will form the base for the next step in our text analysis project and the last step in data preparation for analysis: dataset transformation. This last step in preparing data for analysis is to convert this curated dataset into a dataset that is directly aligned with the research aims (i.e. analysis method(s)) of the project. Since there can be multiple analysis approaches applied the original data in a research project, this curated dataset serves as the point of departure for each of the subsequent datasets derived from the transformational steps.
